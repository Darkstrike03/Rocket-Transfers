      <h2>About Ghostlink</h2>
      <p>Ghostlink is a simple, secure, and ephemeral communication tool designed for quick, private interactions.</p>
      <p>In an age where data retention is the norm, Ghostlink offers a refreshing alternative: a chat and file-sharing platform that vanishes without a trace once the meeting is over.</p>
      <p>We leverage WebRTC technology for direct peer-to-peer connections, meaning your sensitive data largely bypasses our servers. Our goal is to provide a truly private space for your conversations, whether for quick project discussions, sensitive information exchange, or just a casual chat that doesn't need to live forever.</p>
      <p>Ghostlink was created with privacy and simplicity in mind, offering a secure way to connect and disappear.</p>
